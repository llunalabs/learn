# Prerequisites

You've reached the next step of this course! Now before you proceed, we would like you to make sure that you have some of these tools before proceeding. This is needed so as to ensure that you have a smooth learning experience throughout this course.

## Things to install

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Once you've installed these tools, you can proceed to the next section of this course.

To ensure that you have Python installed correctly, do open up your `terminal` (also known as `command prompt`) and type `python --version` or `python3 --version`. You should see the version of the python you installed. If you don't, do refer to this [article](https://www.thecoderworld.com/how-to-add-python-path-to-environment-variables-on-windows-11/) on how to add python to your path.

## Setting up project folder

Awesome! Now that you've installed all the required tools, let's get started by setting up the folder in your desktop.

1. Create an empty folder (you can place this anywhwere in your PC)
2. Open VS Code
3. Click on File > Open Folder > Select the folder you just created
4. Press `CTRL + ~` to open up the terminal.
5. Type `python3 -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment
   - This ensures that all installed dependencies are installed only for this project.
6. To activate your virtual environment
   - Type `venv\Scripts\activate` (for Windows)
   - Type `source venv/bin/activate` (for Mac)
   - You need to run this step everytime you open up a new terminal.
   - To make sure that it's activate, you'll see a `(venv)` prepended to your terminal name

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, youâ€™ve successfully installed venv and activated it. Now let's move on to the next section of this course.
